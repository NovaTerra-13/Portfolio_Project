<h2><strong>Major</strong></h2>
<p>CIS with a concentration in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics</p>

<br>
 <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
 <p>I'm an IT professional of 16 years working in leadership, project management and delivery, and change management. I feel like I've hit a ceiling in my career and was looking for something full of learning opportunities. I've always loved solving problems and puzzles, and one of my most favorite jobs was tracking down hackers that compromised game accounts and reclaiming the assets they stole and restoring the affected account to a pre-compromised state. 
 
 <br><br>
 
 I was exploring certificates from Bristol and cybersecurity sounded like it would scratch that itch for my brain. Once I completed that program, I was so excited about what I was learning that I turned it into an associate's degree. This will be first official semester of college after getting hit by a car derailed my first attempt about 2 decades ago. Before that accident (and briefly after), I was a kindergarten teacher. Since then, I've built a waealth of experience:</p>
 <ul style="font-size:110%;">
 <li>Game Master and Junior Project Manager at Blizzard Entertainment</li>
 <li>Tech Support, then Project Manager of an e-commerce company</li>
 <li>PMO Manager at a Fintech Startup</li>
 <li>Senior Consultant at a mutual insurance company, then hired by the company</li>
 <li>Delivery Lead and Agile Coach at Capital One</li>
 <li>Agile Coach at FM</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Fun fact: I also host and produce 2 podcasts!</p>

 <li>Graduate Summa Cum Laude and as a Commonwealth Honors Scholar from Bristol CC</li>

<h2>My Master Plan (time management)</h2>
<p>Being in the workforce for decades has given me plenty of opportunites to hone my time management skills, especially having worked across corporate and start up type environments. When I had my twins, I honed them even more. It also helps that one of the critical components of my character is accountability.</p>

<h3>These are the general best practices I use for time management:</h3>
<ol>
 <li style="font-size:110%;"><strong>Everything is on a schedule and every schedule syncs</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>So I don't have to track across multiple calendars.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="font-size:110%;"><strong>Preparation time</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I block out half an hour at the beginning and the end of each day to focus on what's coming.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="font-size:110%;"><strong>Tackle big things first</strong></li>
  <li style="font-size:110%;"><strong>Chunk it out</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Break things into smaller chunks of work. Great for building momentum and staying motivated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="font-size:110%;"><strong>Build flexibility in</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>"The best laid plans often blow up" was some great advice given to me young in my career. Allowing for flexibility is key for navigating inevitable interruptions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li style="font-size:110%;"><strong>"Don't worry about it today, think about it tomorrow."</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This advice was given by my spouse's nana and I used to think it was encouraging procrastination. However, I've come to realize it's about realizing that sometimes we need to pause, whether that's for a break or to approach the problem with fresh eyes and mind the next day.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>

<!--<h2>My Learning Style</h2>

<p>I took two quizzes for the sake of having data sets for comparison (and out of my own curiosity). Having been a teacher in the past, I was familiar with learning styles, and it was no surprise to me to find that I have a mix of all of them, though I do have a preference. As I have reflected on myself over the years, I have found that each learning style manifests in different environments and circumstances surrounding the learning. 

<br><br>

For example, if I find material engaging and interesting, I tend to learn best as an auditory learner and participating in discussions. However, for material I find dull or complex, visual aids and where applicable, tactile learning, are best with helping me retain information, followed by nailing it home with a conversation to confirm my understanding. If it's a sport I'm learning, I need to be able to physically practice and repeating mechanics out loud won't help me. I also have a quirk where I need something to do with my hands if I'm stuck in a classroom or work meeting in order to help my mind focus on what is being discussed.

<br><br>

I found some interesting tips in the recommended articles that I'll be giving a try this semester, such as using rhyme and music and reading my notes out loud or repeating what I hear in lectures to help anchor concepts. I'm also looking forward to finding ways to blend the auditory and tactile learning styles so I can understand the theory of what I'm hearing and anchoring it into reality with a hands on approach, like this exercise in creating a website for example.</p>
